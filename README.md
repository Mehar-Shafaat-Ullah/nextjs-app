Next.js/TypeScript Static Web App:
This project is a modern, static web application built using Next.js and TypeScript for robust development and a superior developer experience.

It is deployed to production using a fully automated Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline on AWS, ensuring fast, reliable, and consistent updates.

üåü Key Technologies
Frontend: Next.js

Language: TypeScript



Deployment: AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, S3, and CloudFront

üíª Local Development Setup
Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
You must have the following software installed:

Node.js (version 16 or higher is recommended)

npm or Yarn (npm is used in the commands below)

Git

1. Clone the Repository
Clone the project to your local directory:

git clone (https://github.com/Mehar-Shafaat-Ullah/nextjs-app.git)
cd Your-Repository-Name

2. Install Dependencies
Install the required Node.js packages:

npm install
# OR
yarn install

3. Run the Development Server
Start the application in development mode with hot-reloading:

npm run dev

The application should now be accessible in your browser at: http://localhost:3000

4. Build for Production (Local Check)
To test the production build locally (the static files that are deployed to S3):

npm run build
npm start # This command serves the static output in the .next/ directory

‚òÅÔ∏è AWS CI/CD Deployment Architecture
This project uses a serverless and automated deployment architecture on AWS, which is perfect for Next.js's static export feature.

AWS Service

Role in Project

S3 Bucket (nextjs-static-bucket-2024)

Acts as the Origin Storage. It holds all the static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files generated by the Next.js build (out/ directory).

CloudFront (Distribution ID: E1DYWRI46M8TI)

Acts as the Content Delivery Network (CDN). It caches content at edge locations globally to ensure fast loading times and securely serves the static website content to users.

CodePipeline

The Orchestrator. Manages the full workflow, chaining together the Source, Build, and Deploy stages.

CodeBuild

The Build Engine. Executes the Next.js build command (npm run build, npm run export) and generates the deployable static output files.

Deployment Steps (Automated)
Source Stage: A code change is pushed to the main branch on GitHub.

Build Stage (CodeBuild): CodeBuild pulls the source code and executes the build process defined in the buildspec.yml file, which includes:

Installing dependencies.

Running the Next.js static export (next export).

Packaging the resulting static files.

Deploy Stage: The static files from the build are automatically copied to the S3 Bucket (nextjs-static-bucket-2024).

Cache Invalidation: CloudFront is automatically triggered to invalidate its old cache, ensuring users see the latest deployed version immediately.
